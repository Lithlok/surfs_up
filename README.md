Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

In summary, we see that the temperature differences are not huge, but some additional queries may assist us in deciding if the target location is a good fit for this venture. We could perform the following queries: precipitation and stations.

This would help us to get a picture of rainfall, and focus in on the target location given the best weather reporting station of that area. We could also query other month's data to get an expanded view of the data. The more weather data included in a business proposal that is directly affected by the weather, the better. No one wants to surf with an ice cream cone in the rain! To conclude, I feel that the data gives us a great start at making the decision to open up a shop in Oahu, HI!
